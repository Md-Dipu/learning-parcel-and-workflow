In software development, various **types of commits** help categorize changes and ensure clarity in version control. Each type serves a specific purpose and helps maintain an organized commit history. Here are common commit types, often used in **Conventional Commits**:

### 1. **feat (Feature)**
   - **Description**: A commit that introduces a new feature or functionality to the project.
   - **Example**: `[feat] Add user authentication using JWT`
   - **Purpose**: Indicates that the commit adds something new without fixing or modifying existing functionality.
   
### 2. **fix (Bug Fix)**
   - **Description**: A commit that fixes a bug or addresses an issue within the code.
   - **Example**: `[fix] Correct discount calculation in checkout`
   - **Purpose**: This is used to signal bug fixes that resolve existing problems in the software.

### 3. **docs (Documentation)**
   - **Description**: A commit that updates or adds documentation.
   - **Example**: `[docs] Update installation guide for new users`
   - **Purpose**: Used when making changes to documentation files, like README or API documentation, without affecting code logic.

### 4. **style (Code Style Changes)**
   - **Description**: A commit that applies code formatting or stylistic improvements without affecting the code's functionality.
   - **Example**: `[style] Apply consistent indentation in the stylesheet`
   - **Purpose**: To improve code readability, usually formatting, without functional changes (e.g., fixing whitespace or missing semicolons).

### 5. **refactor (Code Refactoring)**
   - **Description**: A commit that restructures existing code without changing its external behavior or adding new features.
   - **Example**: `[refactor] Optimize data fetching logic for user profiles`
   - **Purpose**: Used for code improvements, cleanup, or restructuring to make the codebase more efficient or readable.

### 6. **test (Tests)**
   - **Description**: A commit that adds or updates tests to the codebase.
   - **Example**: `[test] Add unit tests for authentication module`
   - **Purpose**: Introduces new tests or enhances the test coverage to ensure software correctness.

### 7. **chore (Maintenance Tasks)**
   - **Description**: A commit for changes that are non-functional and typically related to project setup, build tools, or dependencies.
   - **Example**: `[chore] Update Node.js version in CI pipeline`
   - **Purpose**: Includes tasks such as dependency updates, build process changes, or tool configuration without affecting the product code.

### 8. **perf (Performance Improvement)**
   - **Description**: A commit that improves the performance of the code.
   - **Example**: `[perf] Optimize query execution time`
   - **Purpose**: Used when making changes that improve speed or efficiency of the code without affecting the external behavior.

### 9. **ci (Continuous Integration)**
   - **Description**: A commit related to Continuous Integration (CI) configuration or deployment automation.
   - **Example**: `[ci] Fix TravisCI configuration for deployment`
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on updates to CI processes like scripts or configurations, ensuring smooth build and deployment pipelines.

### 10. **build (Build System or Dependency Updates)**
   - **Description**: A commit that changes the build system, package manager, or dependencies.
   - **Example**: `[build] Upgrade Webpack to version 5`
   - **Purpose**: Used when updating the build tools or dependencies that are part of the project’s development ecosystem.

### 11. **revert (Revert Changes)**
   - **Description**: A commit that undoes a previous commit.
   - **Example**: `[revert] Revert commit 123456 due to regression`
   - **Purpose**: Used to reverse changes introduced by an earlier commit, typically to fix regressions or errors caused by recent changes.

### 12. **BREAKING CHANGE**
   - **Description**: A commit that introduces a change that is not backward-compatible, and requires additional changes in the dependent code.
   - **Example**: `[feat] Remove support for legacy authentication APIs`
   - **Purpose**: Used when changes break existing functionality, signaling a major version bump (typically in SemVer).

### Resources for Commit Structures:
- **Conventional Commits**: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) is a specification for writing clear and structured commit messages that can be easily parsed by humans and machines.
- **Commitizen**: A tool that helps developers write commit messages that follow the Conventional Commits standard and is particularly useful for teams who want to enforce consistent commit structures【16†source】【14†source】.

These commit types help maintain a clear and organized history, making it easier for contributors to understand changes and for tools to automate versioning or changelogs.
